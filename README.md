# Blood drive queue

Admin interface of a queue of emails. Pressing the "Call" button sends an email.

In Japan, something like MyJunban (順番待ちシステム) or a similar service is often used to send SNS messages reminding a client of their position in line (on LINE) -- but they're expensive. Hence, the open source version powered by Supabase and Google Scripts.

This is a Google Scripts-powered MUI/React web app (custom theme developed by me).
It was created to maximize participation at a Red Cross Japan blood drive at Christian Academy in Japan. It worked!
